## MODERN WORLD HISTORY
## Second Semester Final Project: Visual Narrative

Students in Dr. Dan Lynch's History class created web-based visual novels for
their final projects.  Each student converted their research and writing about
the experiences of a person involved in World War I or World War II into a
compelling digital presentation - a visual narrative.  


This project was led by student Senya '23, who researched web programming and
visual novels in Honors Computer Science Projects (taught by Dr. Darren
Kessner).
